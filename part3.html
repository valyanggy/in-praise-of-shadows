            <h1>Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, I marvel at our comprehension of the
                secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of shadow and light. For the beauty of the alcove is not the work
                of some clever device. An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light
                drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness. There is nothing more. And yet, when we gaze into the
                darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though we know
                perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the
                atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the darkness immutable tranquility
                holds sway. The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak probably refers to the uncanny silence of
                these dark places. And even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into the
                depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. Where lies the key to this mystery?
                ultimately it is the magic of shadows. Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, the alcove would
                in that instant revert to mere void.</h1>

            <h1>This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light from this empty space they imparted
                to the world of shadows that formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall
                painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, but was by no means so simply achieved. We can imagine
                with little difficulty what extraordinary pains were taken with each invisible detail-the placement of
                the window in the shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam, the height of the threshold. But for me
                the most exquisite touch is-the pale white glow of the shoji in the study bay; I need only pause before
                it and I forget the passage of time. The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting
                window built to provide a place for
                reading. Over the years it came to be regarded as no more than a source of light for the alcove; but
                most often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove as to soften the sidelong rays from without,
                to filter them through paper panels. There is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time it
                reaches these panels. The little sunlight from the garden that manages to make its way beneath the eaves
                and through the corridors has by then lost its power to illuminate, seems drained of the complexion of
                life. It can do no more than accentuate the whiteness of the paper. I sometimes linger before these
                panels and study the surface of the paper, bright, but giving no impression of brilliance. In temple
                architecture the main room stands at a considerable distance from the garden; so dilute is the
                light there that no matter what the season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the
                pale, white glow scarcely varies. And the shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely
                immobile, as if dust collected in the corners had become a part of the paper itself. I blink in
                uncertainty at this dreamlike luminescence, feeling as though some misty film were blunting my vision.
                The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove, is instead
                repelled by the darkness, creating a world of confusion where dark and light are indistinguishable.</h1>


            <h2> Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the light that suffuses such a room, a rare tranquility
                not found in ordinary light?
                <br><br><br><br>
            </h2>
            <h2>Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the ageless, a fear that
                in that room you might lose all consciousness of the passage of time, that untold years might pass and
                upon emerging you should find you had grown old and gray?</h2>

                <p>And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of these huge buildings, to which
                    sunlight never penetrates, how the gold leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant
                    glimmer from the garden, then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow, a faint golden light cast into
                    the enveloping darkness, like the glow upon the horizon at sunset. </p>

                    so exquisitely beautiful. You walk past, turning to look again, and yet again; and as you move away
                    the golden surface of the paper glows ever more deeply, changing not in a flash, but growing slowly,
                    steadily brighter, like color rising in the face of a giant. Or again you may find that the gold
                    dust of the background, which until that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will, as you move
                    past, suddenly gleam forth as if it had burst into flame.

            <h1>How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me. But I see why in
                ancient times statues of the Buddha were gilt with gold and why gold leaf covered the walls of the
                homes of the nobility. Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of the beauty of gold; but
                those who lived in the dark houses of the past were not merely captivated by its beauty, they also
                knew its practical value; for gold, in these dim rooms, must have served the function of a
                reflector. Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was not mere extravagance. Its reflective properties
                were put to use as a source of illumination. Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss, but
                gold retains its brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of the room. This is why gold was
                held in such incredibly high esteem.</h1>
