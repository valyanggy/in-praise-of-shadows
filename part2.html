			<p> Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. Out
				beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or
				build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden steals in
				but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us the
				charm of a room. We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into
				absolute repose. The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of
				the sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy the
				soft fragile beauty of the feeble light. We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading
				rays clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them. We
				never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. And
				so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral
				color. The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so
				much a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the
				viewer. And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a
				tinge peculiarly their own.</p>


			<p>Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging scroll and a flower
				arrangement. But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornaments but rather to give depth to the
				shadows. We value a scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, and thus we
				consider the mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or painting. Even the greatest masterpiece
				will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular
				distinction may blend beautifully with the room and set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its
				surroundings. Wherein lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect? Most often
				the paper, the ink, the fabric of the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, and this look
				of antiquity will strike just the right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room.</p>

			<p>We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a
				scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove. So dark are these
				alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is
				listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, and
				tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be. Yet the combination of that blurred old painting
				and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. </p>


			<p>
				For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface upon which the faint, frail light
				can play; it performs precisely the same function as the sand-textured wall. This is why we attach such
				importance to age and patina. A new painting, even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can
				quite destroy the shadows of an alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care.</p>
